/*
 * Method references in Java provide a shorthand notation to refer to methods or
 * constructors. They can be used in situations where you would otherwise use a
 * lambda expression. Method references make your code more concise and
 * readable, especially when you are working with functional interfaces. Java
 * introduced method references in Java 8 as part of its support for functional
 * programming.
