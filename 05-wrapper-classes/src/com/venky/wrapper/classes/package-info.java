/*
 * Wrapper class help convert primitive types to object types and we
 * mostly use this object type while working with collections.
 *
 *Each primitive type has it's corresponding wrapper classes
 * primitive         wrapper class
 * 
 * byte              Byte
 * short             Short
 * int               Integer
 * long              Long
 * float             Float
 * double            Double
 * boolean           Boolean
 * char              Character 
 * 
 * With the help of wrapper classes we can convert from primitive to object and this
 * process is called as auto-boxing and in the same way we can convert from object to primitive
 * is called as auto un-boxing.
 * 
 * We can convert from primitive to string, string to primitive, object to string,
 * string to object*/
