/*
 * Generics in Java are a powerful feature introduced in Java 5 (also known as
 * Java 1.5) that allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that
 * operate on generic types. Generics provide type safety and enable you to
 * write code that can work with different data types while maintaining
 * compile-time type checking. This allows you to create more flexible and
 * reusable code.
 * 
 * Here are the key concepts and benefits of generics in Java:
 * 
 * Type Safety: Generics provide compile-time type checking, which means that
 * the Java compiler ensures that the code is type-correct before it is
 * executed. This helps prevent type-related runtime errors, such as
 * ClassCastException, by catching them at compile time.
