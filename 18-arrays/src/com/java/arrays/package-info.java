/*
 * Arrays in Java are used to store multiple values of the same data type under
 * a single variable name. They provide a way to efficiently manage and
 * manipulate collections of data. Arrays are widely used in programming for
 * various purposes, such as storing lists of items, processing large datasets,
 * and implementing data structures like stacks and queues.
 * 
 * Here are some key points about arrays in Java:
 * 
 * 1. **Declaration and Initialization:** Arrays are declared using square
 * brackets (`[]`) after the data type. They can be initialized when declared or
 * later using the `new` keyword. For example:
 * 
 * ```java // Declaration and initialization int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
 * 
 * // Declaration, then initialization double[] temperatures; temperatures = new
 * double[7]; ```
 * 
 * 2. **Array Length:** The length of an array is fixed after initialization and
 * is determined by the number of elements it contains. You can access the
 * length using the `length` field:
 * 
 * ```java int size = numbers.length; // size = 5 ```
 * 
 * 3. **Accessing Elements:** Array elements are accessed using an index,
 * starting from 0 for the first element. For example:
 * 
 * ```java int secondElement = numbers[1]; // 2 ```
 * 
 * 4. **Array Index Out of Bounds:** It's important to note that attempting to
 * access an index that is outside the valid range of the array will result in
 * an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
 * 
 * 5. **Iterating Through Arrays:** You can use loops, such as `for` loops, to
 * iterate through array elements:
 * 
 * ```java for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
 * System.out.println(numbers[i]); } ```
 * 
 * 6. **Multidimensional Arrays:** Java supports multidimensional arrays,
 * allowing you to create arrays of arrays. For example, a 2D array is an array
 * of arrays, forming a grid-like structure.
 * 
 * ```java int[][] matrix = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }; ```
 * 
 * 7. **Arrays and Objects:** In Java, arrays are objects, and they can be
 * assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, and returned from
 * methods.
 * 
 * 8. **Arrays with Built-in Methods:** The `java.util.Arrays` class provides
 * various utility methods for working with arrays, including sorting,
 * searching, filling, and more.
 * 
 * 9. **Dynamic Arrays:** While standard arrays have fixed sizes, Java offers
 * dynamic arrays through the `ArrayList` class, which can grow or shrink
 * dynamically as needed.
 * 
 * Arrays are fundamental in Java programming and play a crucial role in
 * handling collections of data efficiently. However, they have some
 * limitations, such as fixed size and performance issues with large datasets.
 * In more complex scenarios, you might consider using other data structures or
 * collections provided by the Java Collections Framework.
