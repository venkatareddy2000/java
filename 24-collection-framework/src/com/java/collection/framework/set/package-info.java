/*
 * In Java, a Set is an interface that is part of the Java Collections
 * Framework. It represents an unordered collection of elements, and it does not
 * allow duplicate elements. The primary purpose of a Set is to store a unique
 * collection of objects. Java provides several classes that implement the Set
 * interface, each with its own characteristics. Here are a few key points about
 * sets in Java:
 * 
 * No Duplicates: A Set does not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add an
 * element that already exists in the set, the insertion operation will have no
 * effect.
 * 
 * Unordered: The elements in a Set are not stored in any specific order. This
 * means you cannot rely on the order of elements within a set.
 * 
 * Interfaces and Implementations: The Set interface defines the common methods
 * that all set implementations must provide. Some common implementations of the
 * Set interface are:
 * 
 * HashSet: Uses a hash table to store elements. Offers constant-time average
 * complexity for basic operations. LinkedHashSet: Maintains the insertion order
 * of elements in addition to being backed by a hash table. TreeSet: Stores
 * elements in a sorted order, either according to their natural ordering or a
 * specified comparator.
