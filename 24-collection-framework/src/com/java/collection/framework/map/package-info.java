/*
 * In Java, a `Map` is an interface that is part of the Java Collections
 * Framework. It represents a collection of key-value pairs where each key is
 * associated with a value. The key in a `Map` is used to uniquely identify the
 * associated value, making it a useful data structure for implementing data
 * structures like dictionaries or associative arrays.
 * 
 * Here are some key points about the `Map` interface in Java:
 * 
 * 1. **Key-Value Pairs:** A `Map` stores data in pairs, where each pair
 * consists of a key and a corresponding value. The key is used to retrieve the
 * associated value. The key and value can be of any object type.
 * 
 * 2. **Uniqueness of Keys:** Keys within a `Map` are unique, meaning that each
 * key can be associated with only one value. If you attempt to add a duplicate
 * key with a different value, it will replace the previous value associated
 * with that key.
 * 
 * 3. **Common Implementations:** There are several common implementations of
 * the `Map` interface in Java, including: - `HashMap`: Provides fast access and
 * insertion but does not guarantee any specific order of the elements. -
 * `TreeMap`: Maintains keys in sorted order. It's slower for insertion and
 * retrieval compared to `HashMap` but allows for range queries. -
 * `LinkedHashMap`: Similar to `HashMap`, but it maintains the order of elements
 * as they were inserted. - `Hashtable`: Similar to `HashMap`, but it's
 * thread-safe (synchronized), which makes it suitable for multithreaded
 * applications. It's generally less efficient than `HashMap`. -
 * `ConcurrentHashMap`: Provides high concurrency for read and write operations,
 * making it suitable for multithreaded applications without the performance
 * bottlenecks of `Hashtable`.
 * 
 * 4. **Basic Operations:** The `Map` interface defines several fundamental
 * methods for working with key-value pairs, including: - `put(key, value)`:
 * Adds a key-value pair to the map. If the key already exists, the previous
 * value associated with that key is replaced. - `get(key)`: Retrieves the value
 * associated with a given key. - `containsKey(key)`: Checks if the map contains
 * a specific key. - `remove(key)`: Removes a key-value pair from the map based
 * on the key. - `size()`: Returns the number of key-value pairs in the map.
 * 
 * 5. **Iterating Over a Map:** You can iterate over the keys, values, or
 * key-value pairs of a map using various methods, including the `keySet()`,
 * `values()`, and `entrySet()` methods.
 * 
 * 6. **Null Values:** Some map implementations, like `HashMap` and `Hashtable`,
 * allow `null` values. This means you can associate a `null` value with a key.
 * However, keys are typically not allowed to be `null`.
 * 
 * 7. **Performance Characteristics:** The performance of map operations
 * (insertion, retrieval, and deletion) can vary depending on the specific map
 * implementation chosen. `HashMap` is often the default choice due to its O(1)
 * average-case time complexity for these operations.
 * 
 * 8. **Concurrent Maps:** For multithreaded applications, `ConcurrentHashMap`
 * provides concurrent access without the need for explicit synchronization,
 * making it a good choice when multiple threads need to access the same map
 * concurrently.
