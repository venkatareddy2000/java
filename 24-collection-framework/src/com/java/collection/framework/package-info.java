/*
 * In Java, a collection is a framework that provides an architecture to store
 * and manipulate a group of objects. It offers various interfaces,
 * implementations, and classes to work with data structures such as lists,
 * sets, maps, queues, and more. Collections provide convenient ways to manage
 * and manipulate groups of objects, and they are an essential part of Java
 * programming.
 * 
 * Here are some key concepts related to collections in Java:
 * 
 * 1. **Interfaces and Implementations:** Java provides several core interfaces
 * in the `java.util` package that define the behavior of different types of
 * collections: - `List`: Ordered collection that allows duplicate elements.
 * Common implementations include `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`. - `Set`:
 * Unordered collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Common
 * implementations include `HashSet` and `TreeSet`. - `Map`: Stores key-value
 * pairs. Common implementations include `HashMap` and `TreeMap`. - `Queue`:
 * Represents a collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
 * Common implementations include `LinkedList` and `PriorityQueue`.
 * 
 * 2. **ArrayList and LinkedList:** - `ArrayList`: Implements a dynamic array
 * that can resize itself as needed. It provides fast random access and is
 * suitable for scenarios where frequent access is required. - `LinkedList`:
 * Implements a doubly-linked list, which is more efficient for insertions and
 * deletions in the middle of the list compared to `ArrayList`.
 * 
 * 3. **HashSet and TreeSet:** - `HashSet`: Implements a collection using a hash
 * table. It doesn't allow duplicate elements and doesn't guarantee any specific
 * order of elements. - `TreeSet`: Implements a sorted set using a red-black
 * tree. Elements are stored in a sorted order, which makes it useful for
 * maintaining a sorted collection.
 * 
 * 4. **HashMap and TreeMap:** - `HashMap`: Implements a map using hash tables.
 * It stores key-value pairs and provides fast retrieval based on keys. It
 * doesn't guarantee any order of elements. - `TreeMap`: Implements a sorted map
 * using a red-black tree. Similar to `TreeSet`, it maintains the elements in a
 * sorted order based on the keys.
 * 
 * 5. **Iteration and Iterators:** Collections provide various ways to iterate
 * over their elements. The `Iterator` interface allows sequential access to the
 * elements in a collection. Enhanced for loops (for-each loops) are also
 * commonly used to iterate over collections.
 * 
 * 6. **Generics:** Most collection classes in Java use generics to ensure type
 * safety. This means you can specify the type of elements a collection will
 * hold, and the compiler will enforce type correctness.
 * 
 * 7. **Utility Methods:** The `Collections` class provides various static
 * utility methods for performing common operations on collections, such as
 * sorting, searching, reversing, and more.
 * 
 * 8. **Concurrency:** Java also offers synchronized versions of some collection
 * classes to make them thread-safe for use in concurrent environments. These
 * classes can be found in the `java.util.concurrent` package.
 * 
 * Overall, collections in Java are a fundamental part of the language,
 * providing versatile ways to manage and manipulate groups of objects
 * efficiently. They help simplify complex data manipulation tasks and are
 * widely used in various Java applications.
