/*
 * Thread groups in Java provide a way to organize and manage threads into a
 * hierarchical structure. While they were more commonly used in earlier
 * versions of Java, they have become less prominent in recent Java programming
 * due to the introduction of more advanced concurrency constructs. However,
 * understanding their use can still be valuable in certain scenarios.
 * 
 * The primary use of thread groups is to provide a way to manage and control a
 * collection of threads as a single unit.
