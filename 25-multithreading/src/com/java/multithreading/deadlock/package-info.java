/*
 * Deadlock in Java is a part of MultiThreading. Deadlock can occur in a
 * situation when a thread is waiting for an object lock, that is acquired by
 * another thread and second thread is waiting for an object lock that is
 * acquired by first thread. Since, both threads are waiting for each other to
 * release the lock, the condition is called deadlock.
