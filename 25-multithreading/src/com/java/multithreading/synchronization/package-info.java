/*
 * In Java, the concept of synchronization is used to ensure that only one
 * thread can access a particular block of code or a section of code at a time.
 * This is crucial when dealing with shared resources or critical sections that
 * could lead to data inconsistency or other issues when accessed concurrently
 * by multiple threads. The synchronized keyword and related constructs are used
 * to achieve synchronization in Java.
 * 
 * The synchronized keyword can be applied to methods or code blocks to ensure
 * that only one thread can execute the synchronized portion at a time.
