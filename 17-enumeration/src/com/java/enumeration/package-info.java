/*
 * In Java, an enumeration, often referred to as an enum, is a special data type
 * that defines a set of constant values. These constant values represent a
 * fixed set of named values, and they are typically used to define a collection
 * of related constants or options. Enumerations provide a way to improve code
 * readability and maintainability by giving meaningful names to these
 * constants.
