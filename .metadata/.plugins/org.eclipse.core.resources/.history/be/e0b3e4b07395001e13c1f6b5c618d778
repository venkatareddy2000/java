/*
 * The ArrayList will store only 10 objects, if we won't specify the size and if
 * we try insert more than 10 objects, the array size will increase to 1.5 times
 * of the default size (that it will store 15 objects) and all the objects will
 * be copied from the old array to the new array.
 * 
 * The ArrayList will be very useful for the faster access of the elements, as
 * we are using the index of an array to retrieve the elements.
 * 
 * Insertion and deletion from an array will take a longer time because it needs
 * to travel to that particular index to insert or delete
 * 
 * In real time applications we use ArrayList where there is more to read
 * instead of inserting or deleting.
