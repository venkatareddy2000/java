/*
 * In java multithreading is the process of executing multiple tasks
 * simultaneously, here every task is a thread
 * 
 * Multithreading is a programming and execution technique used to achieve
 * concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process. A thread is
 * a lightweight unit of a program that can be scheduled for execution by the
 * operating system's thread scheduler. Multithreading allows a single program
 * to perform multiple tasks concurrently, improving efficiency and
 * responsiveness in applications, especially in scenarios where there are tasks
 * that can be executed independently or in parallel.
 * 
 * In a multithreaded program, the main process can create and manage multiple
 * threads, each of which can perform its own set of operations independently.
 * These threads share the same memory space and resources of the process, which
 * allows them to communicate and exchange data more efficiently compared to
 * separate processes.
