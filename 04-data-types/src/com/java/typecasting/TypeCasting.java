		 * Type Casting : Type casting is the process of converting from one data types
		 * to other data type.
		 * 
		 * There are two types of type casting:
		 * 
		 * 1.Implicit type casting: This type casting will be done by the JVM
		 * automatically and in this data type we can convert only from lower data types
		 * to higher data types, there will be a loss of data if we convert from higher
		 * data type conversion to lower data type conversion. So the JVM won't convert
		 * from higher data type to lower data type.
		 * 
		 * 2.Explicit type casting: In this type casting the programmer will convert
		 * from one data type to other data type and even conversion from higher data
		 * types to lower data type is also possible in explicit type casting, but it is
		 * not suggestible as there will be a data loss.
